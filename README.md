A website that I created for fun. It simulates fake stocks (with fake four-letter generated stock codes) that fluctuate in real time every fifteen minutes. 

You can create your own account and choose which stocks to buy using a set amount of virtual money through the Portfolio tab. You can also see which stocks
may rise, and which ones may fall through the News tab. Click on a stock in the Market tab in order to see its fluctuations over time.
Strategize and check out the leaderboard to see who has the most amount of money!
